# Suggestions for Improvement

## Frontend Improvements (User Interface & Experience)

These changes focus on making the dashboard more interactive, informative, and user-friendly.

### Tier 1: High-Impact UI/UX Enhancements

**Visual Diff Viewer**: Instead of showing a plain text snapshot, implement a side-by-side or inline "diff" view that visually highlights added (green) and removed (red) text. This is the single most valuable improvement for quickly understanding changes.

**Historical Timeline View**: Allow a user to click a monitored page and see a version history. Each entry in the history would represent a past change, linking to its specific analysis and snapshot from the logs/ directory.

**Search, Sort, and Filter**:
- Add a search bar to quickly find a specific URL in the sidebar.
- Allow sorting of the monitored pages list by URL, "Last Amended" date, or "Last Checked" date.
- Add controls to filter the list by the latest analysis priority (e.g., show only "Critical" or "High" priority changes).

### Tier 2: Quality-of-Life & Functionality

**User-Managed URL List**: Create a simple "Settings" page within the app that allows a steward to add or remove URLs to be monitored directly from the UI. This would be a major step towards making the tool self-service. (Requires significant backend changes).

**Favicons in Sidebar**: Automatically display the favicon for each monitored URL next to its name in the list for easier visual scanning.

**Dashboard "Home" Page**: Enhance the initial view to be a true dashboard, showing a summary of the most recent changes across all sites (e.g., "3 changes detected in the last 24 hours") instead of just a welcome message.

**Export & Reporting**: Add a button to export the latest analysis for a selected page (or all pages) into a printable PDF or a structured CSV report.

**Dark Mode**: Implement a toggle for a dark color scheme for user comfort.

## Backend Improvements (Python Script & Automation)

These changes focus on making the data capture and analysis more robust, intelligent, and efficient.

### Tier 1: Core Logic & Intelligence

**Smarter Content Extraction**: Instead of grabbing the entire `<body>` of a page, enhance the BeautifulSoup parser to target more specific content containers (e.g., `<main>`, `<article>`, or elements with IDs like `id="content"`). This will dramatically reduce "noise" from irrelevant updates like changing dates in a footer.

**PDF & Document Monitoring**: Extend the `get_content_from_url` function to detect if a URL points to a PDF. If so, it should download the file, extract its text content, and then perform the same hashing and analysis process.

**Keyword Watchlist & Priority Boosting**: Allow a steward to define a list of sensitive keywords (e.g., "arbitration," "data sharing," "indemnify," "jurisdiction"). If a change is detected and one of these keywords is present in the new text, the script could automatically upgrade the analysis priority (e.g., from "Medium" to "High").

**More Descriptive Gemini Prompt**: Enhance the prompt sent to the LLM to ask for more specific insights, such as "Does this change affect user rights, data privacy, or liability? Explain why."

### Tier 2: Scalability & Automation

**Configuration File for URLs**: Move the `URLS_TO_CHECK` list out of the `main.py` script and into a separate, simple `urls.txt` file. This makes it easier to manage the list without editing code.

**"Daily Digest" Summary**: Create a new, separate script that can be run by the workflow to generate a single "Daily Digest" markdown file. This file would summarize all changes detected across all sites in the last 24 hours, providing a high-level briefing.

**Error Notifications**: Modify the `update_checker.yml` workflow to send an email or a Slack/Teams notification if the Python script fails for any reason (e.g., a critical API error, a problem with file permissions).

**Transition to a Database**: For the most robust and scalable solution, replace the file-based system (`hashes.json`, individual analysis files) with a database (SQLite would be a simple starting point). This would make the data easier to query and would be the necessary foundation for features like the user-managed URL list and the historical timeline view.
