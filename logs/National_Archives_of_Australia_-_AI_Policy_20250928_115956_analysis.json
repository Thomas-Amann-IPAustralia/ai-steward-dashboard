    "summary": "The National Archives of Australia's AI Policy document underwent a minor revision.  The changes primarily involve the removal of a temporary announcement regarding system maintenance from the webpage. The core content of the policy regarding AI record management remains unchanged.",
    "analysis": "A comparison of the old and new content reveals only cosmetic differences.  The navigational menu and the temporary service announcement related to website maintenance were removed in the new version. The substantive information regarding the management of records generated by AI technologies, including guidelines for different AI types, retention policies, and examples, is identical.  This suggests a routine update focusing on website presentation rather than policy alterations.",
