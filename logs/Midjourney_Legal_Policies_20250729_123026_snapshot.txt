Our privacy policy outlines how we handle your data
here
. Please carefully read these Terms, along with our privacy policy, and all other documents referenced in these Terms, including the Subscription Plans page and the Community Guidelines below. Together with the Terms, these documents form a single binding agreement between us (the “Agreement”).
This Agreement is effective when the Customer is presented with this Agreement and proceeds to use or access the Services (the "Effective Date") or to receive or distribute Assets. This agreement may be updated and presented again to the Customer from time to time. Continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. If You do not agree to this Agreement, please stop using or accessing the Services.
1. Service Availability and Quality
We are constantly improving the Services to make them better. The Services are subject to modification and change, including but not limited to the art style of Assets, the algorithms used to generate the Assets, and features available to the Customer. No guarantees are made with respect to the Services’ quality, stability, uptime or reliability. Please do not create any dependencies on any attributes of the Services or the Assets. We will not be liable to You or Your downstream customers for any harm caused by Your dependency on the Service.
Both the Services and the Assets are provided to Customer on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Assets and assume any risks associated with use of the Services.
Midjourney reserves the right to suspend or ban Your access to the Services at any time, and for any reason. You may not access or use the Services for purposes of developing or offering competitive products or services. You may not reverse engineer the Services or the Assets. You may not use automated tools to access, interact with, or generate Assets through the Services. You may not resell or redistribute the Services or access to the Service. Only one user may use the Services per registered account. Each user of the Services may only have one account.
You may not use the Service to try to violate the intellectual property rights of others, including copyright, patent, or trademark rights. Doing so may subject you to penalties including legal action or a permanent ban from the Service.
We reserve the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of this Agreement and to take any action we deem appropriate including but not limited to reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to user profiles, e-mail addresses, usage history, posted materials, IP addresses and traffic information.
2. Age Requirements
By accessing the Services, You confirm that You are at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age of digital consent in Your country.

Please ask Your parent or guardian to read these terms with You. If You are a parent or legal guardian, and You allow Your teenager to use the Services, then these terms also apply to You and You are responsible for Your teenager’s activity on the Services.
Midjourney tries to make its Services PG-13 and family friendly, but the Assets are generated by an artificial intelligence system based on user queries. This is new technology and it does not always work as expected. No guarantees are made as to the suitability of the Assets for the Customer.

6. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law
In the event a dispute, controversy, or claim arises out of or relating to these Terms (“Dispute”), the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court.

The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. By agreeing to mandatory arbitration as set forth herein, You and Midjourney knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim, except that either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in the Agreement. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.
Each party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision regarding the Dispute.

We also reserve the right to terminate Your access to the Service for any reason, including for violation of the Community Guidelines or other inappropriate use of the Service. Any violation of Community Guidelines is a breach of this Agreement.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability up to two times within a 12-month period. You may make a verifiable do not sell opt-out request at any time. Any such request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows Us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative thereof; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail such that we may understand, evaluate, and respond to it. Midjourney cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with Midjourney. Midjourney will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you in writing of the extension period and the reason for it. Midjourney will deliver any required or requested responses or other communications in writing to you by email. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. If applicable, the response we provide will also explain any reasons we cannot comply with a request. For data portability requests, Midjourney will provide your personal information in a format that is readily usable and transferable. Midjourney does not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless such requests become excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA. If we determine that a request warrants charging a fee, we will notify you and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
