    "summary": "The National Archives of Australia's AI Policy document has undergone a minor update. The primary change is in the announcement section, where the description of the system maintenance affecting RefTracker has been replaced with an announcement regarding intermittent unavailability of online reference inquiry forms.  The content related to AI record management remains largely unchanged.",
    "analysis": "The changes are superficial and do not affect the core guidance on managing AI-generated records. The update to the announcement suggests a shift in the systems experiencing maintenance. The core policy on AI records management, including the handling of generative AI outputs, traditional AI data, and associated metadata, remains the same.  No substantive changes to the policy's recommendations or principles were identified.",
