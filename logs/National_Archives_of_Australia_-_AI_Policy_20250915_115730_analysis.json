    "summary": "The main change between the old and new versions of the \"National Archives of Australia - AI Policy\" document is the addition of a brief announcement regarding temporary unavailability of the RefTracker system due to maintenance.  The core content of the AI policy document itself remains unchanged.",
    "analysis": "The updated document includes a temporary announcement at the top regarding system maintenance impacting RefTracker. This is a minor, non-substantial change and does not affect the policy's guidance on managing AI-generated records. The rest of the document, including sections on types of AI technologies, record types, general principles, retention policies, and managing AI in business systems, remains identical.  The date remains January 2025, indicating that the policy itself hasn't been updated.",
