    "summary": "The Digital.gov.au AI Policy has been significantly updated.  The new version includes a detailed implementation plan with timelines, clearly defined roles and responsibilities for accountable officials,  a focus on staff training, and an emphasis on integrating AI into existing frameworks.  Specific guidance is provided for implementing the policy, including a pilot AI assurance framework, and the policy now explicitly defines AI using the OECD definition.  National security carve-outs for Defence and the National Intelligence Community are also explicitly stated.",
    "analysis": "The most significant changes are the addition of detailed implementation steps, timelines (e.g., 90 days for accountable official designation, 6 months for AI fundamentals training), and clearly defined responsibilities for accountable officials. The policy now provides a structured approach to AI adoption, including a risk matrix and recommendations for staff training. The inclusion of an OECD-based definition of AI adds clarity and aligns the Australian policy with international standards.  The explicit carve-outs for national security are a crucial addition, clarifying the policy's scope and limitations. The overall structure and content indicate a move from a high-level aspirational policy to a more practical and actionable implementation guide.",
