    "summary": "The Google AI Principles document remains unchanged.  However, the Google Terms of Service document, linked within the Google AI Policies, is now inaccessible, returning a 'Residential Failed' error message indicating that access is restricted.",
    "analysis": "The lack of access to the Google Terms of Service is a significant change.

The inability to access the Terms of Service could be temporary (e.g., a website issue), or it could indicate a more substantial policy update not yet publicly available. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and nature of the Terms of Service inaccessibility.",
