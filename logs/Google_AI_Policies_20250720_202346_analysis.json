    "summary": "The most significant change is the replacement of the Google AI Principles document content with a security warning about a certificate authority issue on the ai.google and policies.google domains.",
    "analysis": "The new content completely replaces the old content.  The old content consisted of Google's AI Principles document, detailing their approach to AI development and deployment. This included a statement of principles, elaboration on each principle, and links to further resources on responsible AI.  The new content is a security warning indicating a certificate authority issue.  It displays an `net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` error, certificate details (subject, issuer, expiry date), and the PEM encoded certificate chain for both `*.ai.google` and `*.google.com`.  It also includes a prompt to help improve web security by sending data to Google, along with links to the privacy policy and enhanced protection settings in Chrome.  In essence, the old document was replaced by a completely unrelated security warning page.",
