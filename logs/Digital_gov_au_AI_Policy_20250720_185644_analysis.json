    "summary": "The Digital.gov.au AI Policy has undergone minor revisions.  The core structure and principles remain largely the same, focusing on enabling responsible AI adoption across the Australian government.  Key changes include the addition of mandatory requirements for AI transparency statements, requiring agencies to publicly disclose their AI usage and mitigation strategies.  There is also a strong recommendation for AI fundamentals training for all staff within six months of the policy's effective date.  The policy continues to emphasize ethical considerations, risk mitigation, and ongoing review and adaptation.",
    "analysis": "The changes reflect a shift towards greater transparency and accountability in the government's use of AI. The mandatory transparency statement requirement enhances public oversight, while the emphasis on staff training underscores the importance of building internal capacity and expertise.  The lack of substantial changes suggests a focus on implementing existing provisions rather than a major policy overhaul.  The unchanged exclusion of the defense and national intelligence communities highlights the complexities and sensitivities surrounding AI adoption in national security contexts.",
