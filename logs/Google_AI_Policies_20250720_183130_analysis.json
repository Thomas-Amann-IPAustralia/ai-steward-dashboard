    "summary": "The Google AI Policies document has undergone a significant revision. The old content consisted primarily of SSL certificate error messages, while the new content is a comprehensive Terms of Service document outlining user responsibilities, Google's responsibilities, intellectual property rights concerning user content, and dispute resolution processes.  The AI Principles document remains largely unchanged, focusing on Google's approach to responsible AI development and deployment.",
    "analysis": "The most substantial change is the replacement of the old, error-filled \"Google AI Policies\" with a detailed Terms of Service document.  This new document provides a structured framework for the relationship between Google and its users, covering usage guidelines, content ownership and licensing, liability limitations, and dispute resolution.  It represents a significant shift from a technical error page to a legal and operational framework. The AI Principles document has seen minor updates such as addition of links and report updates but no fundamental changes to its core principles. The update focuses on clarifying Google's commitment to responsible AI and providing more resources related to responsible AI development.",
