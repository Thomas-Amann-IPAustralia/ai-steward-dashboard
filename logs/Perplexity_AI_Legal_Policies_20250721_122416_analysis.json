    "summary": "The provided text shows updates to Perplexity AI's legal policies.  The most significant change is the addition of comprehensive Terms of Service, covering user accounts, subscriptions, payments, product orders, usage restrictions, disclaimers, liability limitations, and a mandatory arbitration clause with a class action waiver.  The Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy have also been updated with minor revisions and clarifications but remain largely unchanged.",
    "analysis": {
        "Terms of Service": "A new Terms of Service document has been introduced.  This document comprehensively outlines the rules and regulations governing user interactions with Perplexity's services, including account creation, subscriptions (with details on billing, renewals, and cancellations), purchases, acceptable use, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and a binding arbitration agreement that includes a class action waiver.  This represents a substantial addition to Perplexity's legal framework.",
        "Privacy Policy": "The Privacy Policy has undergone minor revisions.  While the core elements remain similar (data collection, use, disclosure, etc.), there might be updated language clarifying data handling practices, legal bases for processing, and possibly reflecting compliance with updated regulations. Specific changes are not readily discernible without a direct comparison of the old and new policy word-for-word.",
        "Acceptable Use Policy": "The Acceptable Use Policy has received minor updates, likely focusing on clarifying prohibited activities in light of recent AI developments and regulatory changes. A direct comparison between old and new versions would reveal any specific modifications.",
        "Overall": "The changes indicate a strengthening of Perplexity AI's legal posture, particularly with the introduction of detailed Terms of Service. This suggests a proactive approach to risk management and user protection."
