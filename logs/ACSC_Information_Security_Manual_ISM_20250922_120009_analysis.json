    "summary": "The only change detected between the old and new content of the ACSC Information Security Manual (ISM) is a 100KB increase in the size of the main PDF document.  The version number and date remain the same (September 2025). All other elements, including supporting documents and website structure, are identical.",
    "analysis": "The increase in file size of the main ISM PDF suggests minor updates or additions to the content, but without access to the PDF content itself, the precise nature of these changes cannot be determined.  The lack of other changes implies that these updates were likely minor edits, formatting adjustments, or perhaps the inclusion of a small amount of new material.  The absence of any version number change points towards minor revisions instead of a major update.  Further investigation is needed to understand the nature of the file size increase.",
