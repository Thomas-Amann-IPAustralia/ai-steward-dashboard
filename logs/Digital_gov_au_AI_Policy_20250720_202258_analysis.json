    "summary": "The most significant change is the addition of mandatory AI transparency statements requiring agencies to publicly disclose their AI adoption and usage.",
    "analysis": "The revised `Digital.gov.au AI Policy` introduces a new mandatory requirement for AI transparency.  Specifically:\n\n* **New Mandatory Requirement: AI Transparency Statement:** Agencies *must* publicly release a statement detailing their AI approach within six months of the policy's effective date. This statement must be updated annually or sooner if significant changes occur.  The statement must include information on policy compliance, effectiveness monitoring of deployed AI systems, and efforts to protect the public from negative impacts.  A standard for these statements is referenced.\n\n* **Accountable Officials:**  The policy now mandates that agencies designate accountable officials within 90 days of the policy taking effect. These officials have responsibilities including implementation oversight, notifying the DTA of high-risk use cases (using a provided risk matrix), serving as a contact point for whole-of-government AI coordination, participating in AI forums, and staying updated on evolving requirements.  An email address (ai@dta.gov.au) is provided for communication with the DTA.\n\n* **Staff Training:** The policy strongly recommends AI fundamentals training for all staff within six months and additional role-specific training, with guidance links provided.\n\n* **Recommended Actions:**  The policy includes sections suggesting agencies understand and register their internal AI usage, integrate AI considerations into existing frameworks (privacy, security, etc.), participate in the AI assurance framework pilot, and apply generative AI guidance.\n\nNo content was removed from the original policy. The changes primarily involve the addition of specific requirements and recommendations to enhance AI governance and transparency.",
