    "summary": "The Perplexity AI Legal Policies show no substantive changes in the Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, or Privacy Policy content between the old and new versions.  The only differences are the 'Last updated' dates, reflecting that the documents were updated at different times. The Terms of Service date remains June 4th, 2024, while the Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy dates are July 8th, 2025 and February 2nd, 2025 respectively.",
    "analysis": "The lack of content changes suggests that the updates were likely minor, perhaps addressing formatting, typos, or internal references. A more detailed comparison would be needed to confirm this hypothesis, potentially examining version history if available.  The discrepancies in 'Last updated' dates might indicate asynchronous updates to the policy documents, a common practice for large-scale policy revisions.  It's recommended to check for changes in the underlying legal terms within each section, comparing the document versions using a diff tool for a thorough comparison.",
