Implementation
Application
This policy took effect on
1 September 2024
.
Consistent with other whole-of-government digital policies, all
non-corporate Commonwealth entities
(NCEs), as defined by the
Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013
, must apply this policy.
Corporate Commonwealth entities
are also encouraged to apply this policy.
National security carveouts
This policy does not apply to the use of AI in the defence portfolio.
This policy does not apply to the ‘national intelligence community’ (NIC) as defined by Section 4 of the
Office of National Intelligence Act 2018
.
The NIC includes:
Office of National Intelligence (ONI)
Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO)
Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS)
Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation (AGO)
Defence Intelligence Organisation (DIO)
Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC)
the intelligence role and functions of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), Australian Federal Police (AFP), the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Defence.
Defence and members of the NIC may voluntarily adopt elements of this policy where they are able to do so without compromising national security capabilities or interests.
Existing frameworks
The challenges raised by government use of AI are complex and inherently linked with other issues, such as:
the APS Code of Conduct
data governance
cyber security
privacy
ethics practices.
This policy has been designed to complement and strengthen – not duplicate – existing frameworks, legislation and practices that touch upon government’s use of AI.
This policy must be read and applied alongside existing frameworks and laws to ensure agencies meet all their obligations.

Artificial intelligence definition
While there are various definitions of what constitutes AI, for the purposes of this policy agencies should apply the definition provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD):
An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.
Agencies may refer to further
explanatory material on the OECD website
.
Given the rapidly changing nature of AI, agencies should keep up to date on any updates or changes to this definition. The definition in this policy will be reviewed as the broader, whole-of-economy regulatory environment matures to ensure an aligned approach.

Principles
Safely engage with AI to enhance productivity, decision-making, policy outcomes and government service delivery for the benefit of Australians.
APS officers need to be able to explain, justify and take ownership of advice and decisions when utilising AI.
Have clear accountabilities for the adoption of AI and understand its use.
Build AI capability for the long term.
Mandatory requirements
Accountable officials
Agencies
must
designate accountability for implementing this policy to accountable official(s) within 90 days of this policy taking effect.
The responsibilities may be vested in an individual or in the chair of a body. The responsibilities may also be split across officials or existing roles (such as Chief Information Officer, Chief Technology Officer or Chief Data Officer) to suit agency preferences.
The responsibilities of the accountable officials are to:
be accountable for implementation of this policy within their agencies
notify the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) where the agency has identified a new high-risk use case by emailing
ai@dta.gov.au
. This information will be used by the DTA to build visibility and inform the development of further risk mitigation approaches. Agencies may wish to use the
risk matrix
to determine risk ratings.
be a contact point for whole-of-government AI coordination
engage in whole-of-government AI forums and processes
keep up to date with changing requirements as they evolve over time.
Agencies are to email the DTA when they designate and make any changes to their accountable official(s) by emailing
ai@dta.gov.au
Standard for accountable officials

Recommended actions
Staff training on AI
It is
strongly recommended
that agencies implement:
AI fundamentals training for all staff, aligned to the approach under the policy guidance, within 6 months of this policy taking effect
additional training for staff as required, in consideration of their roles and responsibilities, such as those responsible for the procurement, development, training and deployment of AI systems.
