    "summary": "The provided text shows updates to Midjourney's Terms of Service and a largely unchanged Privacy Policy. The Terms of Service document has been completely replaced with a new version, which includes details on service availability, user content rights, DMCA takedown procedures, dispute resolution, payment and billing, community guidelines, limitations of liability, and provisions for the image editor and video model.  The Privacy Policy shows only a minor update to the 'Last Updated' date.",
    "analysis": "The most significant change is the introduction of a comprehensive Terms of Service document. This document clarifies Midjourney's policies on intellectual property rights (user ownership, Midjourney's license), acceptable use (community guidelines), and liability.  The updated Terms of Service also introduces a binding arbitration clause for dispute resolution and details the processes for DMCA takedown and counter-notification. The Privacy Policy remains largely the same, with only a date update, suggesting that the focus of the changes lies in establishing clear terms of use rather than data handling.",
