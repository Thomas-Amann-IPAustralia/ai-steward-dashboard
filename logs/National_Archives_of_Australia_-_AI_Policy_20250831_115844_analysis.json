    "summary": "The National Archives of Australia's AI Policy document has been updated with a new announcement regarding temporary RecordSearch unavailability due to system maintenance from 9 am on Saturday, August 30th, to 8 pm on Sunday, August 31st.  The core content regarding AI record management remains unchanged.",
    "analysis": "The only substantive change detected is the addition of a brief announcement regarding scheduled system maintenance for RecordSearch.  The main body of the policy document, which covers the management of records created using artificial intelligence technologies, is identical.  This suggests a minor, temporary update unrelated to the policy's core content.",
