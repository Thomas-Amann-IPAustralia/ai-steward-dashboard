    "summary": "No substantive changes were detected between the old and new content of the ACSC Information Security Manual (ISM).  The only difference is a minor wording change in the call to action for reporting security incidents; 'cyber security' is now consistently written as two words instead of one in some places.",
    "analysis": "A comparison of the provided text reveals almost no difference. The alteration in the phrasing of \"cyber security\" is superficial and unlikely to have any impact on the policy's content or implementation.  Further analysis would require access to the actual PDF documents themselves to confirm if any unapparent changes exist within the document content.",
