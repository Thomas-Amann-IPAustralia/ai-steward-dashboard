    "summary": "The provided text shows no changes in the \"Perplexity AI Legal Policies\" documents.  All four documents (Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, Privacy Policy, and an un-named fourth document) are identical in both the 'OLD CONTENT' and 'NEW CONTENT' sections. The only differences are the inclusion of the 'OLD CONTENT' and 'NEW CONTENT' headers and the dates in the headers, which are not part of the actual policy documents themselves.",
    "analysis": "There is no evidence of any updates or revisions to the Perplexity AI legal policies.  The 'Last Updated' dates vary in the headers, but the content itself remains unchanged. This suggests either an error in the provided data or that no policy updates occurred between the presumed times indicated.",
