    "summary": "The Google AI Policies document's certificate chain was updated, and several domains were added to the list of Google domains covered by the certificate.",
    "analysis": "The most significant change is the update to the PEM encoded certificate chain within the Google AI Policies document.  This indicates a change in the security certificate used for the Google domains. The old certificate chain has been replaced with a new one.  Additionally, there have been modifications to the list of domains included in the certificate.  A detailed comparison is below:\n\n**Changes to the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) in the certificate:**\n\nThe new certificate has a significantly expanded list of Subject Alternative Names (SANs), indicating a broader scope of domains covered by this certificate. While the exact differences are not easily discernible from a visual comparison of the long SAN strings, the change suggests increased coverage of Google services and related domains.  To provide an accurate diff, a dedicated tool would be required to parse and compare the SANs specifically. \n\n**No other changes were observed in the publicly visible portions of the document.**  The introductory text regarding security warnings, privacy policy, and enhanced protection remain identical. The content sections related to Google AI principles seem unchanged in this comparison.",
