    "summary": "The Google AI Policies document remains largely unchanged, with the core Terms of Service showing no substantive alterations.  The primary difference lies in the addition of a language selection dropdown in the Terms of Service document, offering improved accessibility. The separate AI Principles document also remains consistent.",
    "analysis": "The analysis reveals minimal changes between the old and new versions of the 'Google AI Policies'. The Terms of Service document, which forms a major part of the policies, has only seen a superficial update: the addition of a multi-lingual dropdown menu.  This improves usability but does not alter the underlying legal agreements. The AI Principles document shows no detectable changes in its content.  Therefore, the overall impact of the changes is insignificant from a policy perspective.",
