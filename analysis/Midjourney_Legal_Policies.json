    "summary": "The provided text shows two documents: a Privacy Policy (last updated June 2, 2025) and Terms of Service (effective June 23, 2025).  The Terms of Service introduce new sections on content rights, a DMCA takedown policy, dispute resolution, service limitations, payment and billing, community guidelines, limitations of liability, and an image editor/video model section.  The Privacy Policy remains largely unchanged, though its last updated date precedes that of the Terms of Service.",
    "analysis": "The most significant changes are within the Terms of Service document.  These changes clarify user rights regarding generated assets, establish a DMCA process for copyright infringement, outline a binding arbitration process for disputes, define service limitations and rate limiting, detail billing and payment procedures, and introduce community guidelines to govern user behavior.  The addition of sections on liability limitations and specifics about the image editor and video model further formalizes Midjourney's legal position and user expectations.  The Privacy Policy, while not substantially altered, shows an older update date, suggesting a need for alignment with the newer Terms of Service.",
