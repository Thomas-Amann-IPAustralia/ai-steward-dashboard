    "summary": "The updated National Archives of Australia AI Policy shows minor changes primarily in the \"Students and Teachers\" section of the website navigation menu.  The main policy content regarding AI record management remains largely unchanged. The only substantive alteration is the replacement of \"Teacher professional learning\" with \"Teacher e-newsletter\" in the navigation menu.",
    "analysis": "The lack of significant changes in the policy document itself suggests a stable understanding of AI record management practices within the National Archives. The menu update is a superficial change impacting website usability rather than policy substance. The policy continues to emphasize a risk-based approach to managing AI-generated records, aligning with the “Archives Act 1983” and other relevant Australian Government frameworks.  The document's continued emphasis on human oversight of AI-generated content and the need for appropriate metadata remains consistent.",
