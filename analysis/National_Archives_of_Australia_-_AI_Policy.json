    "summary": "The National Archives of Australia's AI Policy document has undergone a minor revision.  The main change appears to be the removal of a temporary announcement regarding RecordSearch system maintenance. The core content regarding AI record management remains unchanged, including guidance on generative and traditional AI, record types, retention policies, and management of AI systems. The document's date remains January 2025.",
    "analysis": "The difference between the old and new content is solely the absence of a temporary service interruption notice.  No substantive changes to the AI policy itself were detected.  This suggests a routine update to the website rather than a policy revision. The core guidance on AI record management practices remains consistent.",
