    "summary": "The National Archives of Australia's AI Policy document underwent a minor revision.  The most significant change is the removal of a temporary service interruption announcement related to RecordSearch. The content of the AI policy itself remains unchanged.",
    "analysis": "A comparison of the old and new content reveals only a cosmetic change.  The main body of the policy document, covering AI technologies, record types, management principles, and retention guidelines, is identical.  The only difference lies in the removal of a temporary announcement regarding RecordSearch maintenance. This suggests a routine update to the website rather than a substantive alteration to the AI policy itself.",
