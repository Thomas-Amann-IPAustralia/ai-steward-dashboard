We will provide notice to you before linking your Account to an organization's enterprise account. However, if the organization is responsible for notifying you or has already informed you that it may monitor and control your Account, we may not provide additional notice.
Evaluation and Additional Services.
In some cases, we may permit you to evaluate our Services for a limited time or with limited functionality. Use of our Services for evaluation purposes are for your personal, non-commercial use only.
You may need to accept additional terms to use certain Services. These additional terms will supplement our Terms for those Services and may change your rights or obligations for those Services, including your obligations to pay fees.
3. Use of our Services.
You may access and use our Services only in compliance with our Terms, including our
Acceptable Use Policy
, the policy governing
the countries and regions Anthropic currently supports
("Supported Regions Policy"), and any guidelines or supplemental terms we may post on the Services (the “
Permitted Use
”). You are responsible for all activity under the account through which you access the Services.
You may not access or use, or help another person to access or use, our Services in the following ways:
In any manner that violates any applicable law or regulation—including, without limitation, any laws about exporting data or software to and from the United States or other countries.
To develop any products or services that compete with our Services, including to develop or train any artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms or models or resell the Services.

You also must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our Services, including, for example, introducing viruses or malware, spamming or DDoSing Services, or bypassing any of our systems or protective measures.
4. Inputs, Outputs, Actions, and Materials.
Generally.
You may be allowed to interact with our Services in a variety of formats (we call these “
Inputs
”). Our Services may generate responses (we call these “
Outputs
”), or enable the Services to take actions on your behalf, such as software manipulation, data processing, and system interactions (we call these
"Actions"
), based on your Inputs. Inputs and Outputs collectively are “
Materials
.”
Rights and Responsibilities.
You are responsible for all Inputs you submit to our Services and all Actions. By submitting Inputs to our Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions that are necessary for us to process the Inputs under our Terms and to provide the Services to you, including for example, to integrate with third-party services, to share Materials with others at your direction, and to take Actions. You also represent and warrant that your submitting Inputs to us or directing Claude to take Actions will not violate our Terms, our
Acceptable Use Policy
, or any laws or regulations applicable to those Inputs or Actions. As between you and Anthropic, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you retain any right, title, and interest that you have in the Inputs you submit. Subject to your compliance with our Terms, we assign to you all of our right, title, and interest—if any—in Outputs.
Reliance on Outputs and Actions.
Artificial intelligence and large language models are frontier technologies that are still improving in accuracy, reliability and safety. When you use our Services, you acknowledge and agree:
Outputs may not always be accurate and may contain material inaccuracies even if they appear accurate because of their level of detail or specificity.
Actions may not be error free or operate as you intended.
You should not rely on any Outputs or Actions without independently confirming their accuracy.
The Services and any Outputs may not reflect correct, current, or complete information.
Outputs may contain content that is inconsistent with Anthropic’s views.
Our use of Materials.
We may use Materials to provide, maintain, and improve the Services and to develop other products and services. We will not train our models on any Materials that are not publicly available, except in two circumstances:
If you provide Feedback to us (through the Services or otherwise) regarding any Materials, we may use that Feedback in accordance with Section 5 (Feedback).
If your Materials are flagged for trust and safety review, we may use or analyze those Materials to improve our ability to detect and enforce
Acceptable Use Policy
violations, including training models for use by our trust and safety team, consistent with Anthropic’s safety mission.
5. Feedback
We appreciate feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating an Output in response to an Input (“
Feedback
”). If you rate an Output in response to an Input—for example, by using the thumbs up/thumbs down icon—we will store the related conversation as part of your Feedback. You have no obligation to give us Feedback, but if you do, you agree that we may use the Feedback however we choose without any obligation or other payment to you.
6. Subscriptions, fees and payment.
Fees and billing.
You may be required to pay us fees to access or use our Services or certain features of our Services. You are responsible for paying any applicable fees listed for the Services on the
Model Pricing Page
unless otherwise communicated to you by Anthropic in writing.
If you purchase access to our Services or features of our Services, you must provide complete and accurate billing information (“
Payment Method
”). You agree that we may charge the Payment Method for any applicable fees listed on our Services and any applicable tax. If the fees for these Services or features are specified to be recurring or based on usage, you agree that we may charge these fees and applicable taxes to the Payment Method on a periodic basis.
If you purchase access to our Services through a distributor (e.g. an app store) (
“App Distributor”
), then you will make payment to the App Distributor, and the App Distributor’s terms in relation to payment methods, billing, and refunds will apply instead of these Terms.
Except as expressly provided in these Terms or where required by law, all payments are non-refundable. Please check your order carefully before confirming it, and see below for additional information about recurring charges for our subscriptions.
Additional fees.
We may increase fees for our Services. If we charge additional fees in connection with our Services, we will give you an opportunity to review and accept the additional fees before you are charged. Also, additional fees may apply for additional Services or features of the Services that we may make available. If you do not accept any such additional fees, we may discontinue your access to the Services or features.
You agree that we will not be held liable for any errors caused by third-party payment processors used to process fees paid by you to us.
Subscriptions.
To access Claude Pro and other subscription services we may make available to individuals, you must sign up for a subscription with us (a “
Subscription
”), first by creating an Account, and then following the subscription procedure on our Services. When you sign up for a Subscription, you agree to these Terms.
Subscription content, features, and services.
The content, features, and other services provided as part of your Subscription, and the duration of your Subscription, will be described in the order process. We may change the content, features, and other services from time to time, and we do not guarantee that any particular piece of content, feature, or other service will always be available through the Services.
Subscription term and automatic renewal.
If you sign up for a paid Subscription, we or the App Distributor will automatically charge your Payment Method on each agreed-upon periodic renewal date until you cancel. If your Subscription has a minimum term (the “
Initial Term
”), we will let you know during the order process. Your Subscription will last for the Initial Term and will automatically renew, and your Payment Method will be charged, at the end of the Initial Term for an additional term equal in duration to the Initial Term and will continue to renew and incur charges for additional terms equal in duration to the Initial Term (each such additional term, a “
Renewal Term
”) until you cancel.
Subscription cancellation.
If you subscribed via our website, you may cancel your Subscription for any reason by using a method we may provide to you through our products—for example, for Claude Pro, in your customer portal—or by notifying us at
support@anthropic.com
. If you subscribed via an app, you’ll need to cancel via the App Distributor according to the App Distributor’s terms. Learn more
here
. To avoid renewal and charges for the next Renewal Term, cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the last day of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. For example, if you subscribe on January 25th for a Subscription with a one-month Initial Term, you must cancel the Subscription per the instructions by February 23rd (24 hours before February 24th) to avoid renewal and charges for the next Renewal Term. In the event of a cancellation, your fees will not be refunded, but your access to the Services will continue through the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term for which you previously paid fees.
Subscription fees.
You will pay the fees, either to us or to the App Distributor, for the Initial Term and each subsequent Renewal Term up front, at the start of that Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. We have the right to make changes to the fees applicable to your Subscription from time to time, although we will not make any change to the fees applicable to your Subscription during the current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. If these changes result in an increase in the fees payable by you, we will inform you at least 30 days in advance of the change. You agree to the increase in fees payable by you unless you cancel the Subscription, as described in the paragraph (Subscription cancellation) immediately above, before the Renewal Term to which the increase in fees will apply.
7. Third-party services and links
Our Services may use or be used in connection with third-party content ("
Third-Party Content
"), services, or integrations. We do not control or accept responsibility for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of any Third-Party Content, services, and integrations, for which we make no representations or warranties. Your use of any Third-Party Content, services, and integrations is at your own risk and subject to any terms, conditions, or policies (including privacy policies) applicable to such third-party content, services, and integrations.
8. Content Moderation
Third-Party Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to our Services. Anthropic is under no obligation to host or serve Third-Party Content. Third-Party Content may appear in Inputs or Outputs and become part of Materials. If you see any Third-Party Content you believe does not comply with these Terms, including by violating the Acceptable Use Policy or the law, you can
report
it to us.
If we become aware that any Third-Party Content (1) infringes another’s copyright or any other intellectual property or related or neighboring right, (2) is in breach of these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy, or (3) may cause harm to Anthropic, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down some or all of such Third-Party Content using, where appropriate, algorithmic and human review.
You can learn more about our monitoring and enforcement, including how to appeal an account suspension or termination, in our
T&S Support Center

9. Software
We may offer manual or automatic updates to our software including our apps (“
Anthropic Software
”), without advance notice to you. Anthropic Software may include open source software. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other Anthropic or third-party terms applicable to any portion of Anthropic Software, such as open-source license terms, such other terms will control as to that portion of the Anthropic Software and to the extent of the conflict.
10. Ownership of the Services
The Services are owned, operated, and provided by us and our affiliates, licensors, distributors, and service providers (collectively “
Providers
”). We and our Providers retain all of our respective rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Services. Other than the rights of access and use expressly granted in our Terms, our Terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in or to our Services.
11. Disclaimer of warranties, limitations of liability, and indemnity
Our team works hard to provide great services, and we’re continuously working on improvements. However, there are certain aspects we can’t guarantee. We are using ALL CAPS to explain this, to make sure that you see it.
YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, MATERIALS, AND ACTIONS IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICES, OUTPUTS, AND ACTIONS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. WE AND OUR PROVIDERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, SECURITY, PRIVACY, COMPATIBILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTY IMPLIED BY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR TRADE USAGE.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE, OUR PROVIDERS, OR OUR OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, INVESTORS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “ANTHROPIC PARTIES”), BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SERVICES, THE MATERIALS, THE ACTIONS, OR THESE TERMS, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF ANY ANTHROPIC PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF THE DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE ANTHROPIC PARTIES’ TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SERVICES, THE MATERIALS, THE ACTIONS, OR THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES (IF ANY) IN THE SIX MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE SUCH DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION FIRST AROSE, AND $100. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THESE TERMS, AND WE WOULD NOT OFFER THE SERVICES TO YOU UNDER THESE TERMS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE ANTHROPIC PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS), AND OTHER LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF THESE TERMS; YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR ALLEGED USE OF THE SERVICES, THE MATERIALS, OR THE ACTIONS; YOUR FEEDBACK; ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT YOU DEVELOP, OFFER, OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE USING OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES; YOUR VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR ANY THIRD-PARTY RIGHT; AND ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED FRAUD, INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, OR CRIMINAL ACTS COMMITTED BY YOU OR YOUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS.

OUR PROVIDERS ARE INTENDED THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 11.
12. General terms
Changes to the Services.
Our Services are novel and will change. We may sometimes add or remove features, increase or decrease capacity limits, offer new Services, or stop offering certain Services.
Unless we specifically agree otherwise in a separate agreement with you, we reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or your access to the Services, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. Although we will strive to provide you with reasonable advance notice if we stop offering a Service, there may be urgent situations—such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues—where providing advance notice is not feasible. We will not be liable for any change to or any suspension or discontinuation of the Services or your access to them.
Changes to these terms.
We may revise and update these Terms at our discretion. Some examples of times, we may update these Terms include (1) to reflect changes in our Services, like when we add or remove features or services, or update our pricing, (2) for security or legal reasons, or (3) to promote safety or prevent abuse. If you continue to access the Services after we post the updated Terms on Anthropic’s website or otherwise give you notice of Terms changes, then you agree to the updated Terms. If you do not accept the updated Terms, you must stop using our Services.
Supplemental terms.
We may offer Services or features that we believe require service-specific terms or guidelines. When using our Services, you agree to comply with any applicable guidelines, rules, or supplemental terms that may be posted on the Services from time to time (“Supplemental Terms”). If these Terms conflict with Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will govern for the applicable Service.
Entire agreement.
These Terms and any other terms expressly incorporated by reference form the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of our Terms.
Termination.
You may stop accessing the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services (including any Subscriptions) at any time without notice to you if we believe that you have breached these Terms, or if we must do so in order to comply with law. If we terminate your access to the Services due to a violation of these Terms and you have a Subscription, you will not be entitled to any refund. In addition, if you have a Subscription, we may terminate the Subscription at any time for any other reason. If we exercise this right and you purchased the subscription via our website, we will refund you, on a pro rata basis, the fees you paid for the remaining portion of your Subscription after termination. Any refunds for Subscriptions purchased via an App Distributor are subject to the App Distributor’s terms and not these terms.
We may also terminate your Account if you have been inactive for over a year and you do not have a paid Account. If we terminate your Account due to inactivity, we will provide you with notice before doing so.
Upon termination of these Terms, a Subscription, or your access to the Services, we may at our option delete any Materials or other data associated with your Account. Sections 6 (with respect to fees outstanding as of such expiration or termination) and 9 – 12 will survive any expiration or termination of our Terms or a Subscription.
Severability.
If a particular Term or portion of these Terms is not valid or enforceable, this will have no effect on any other Terms.
No waiver.
Any delay or failure on our part to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of our right to enforce them later.
No assignment.
These Terms may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior written consent, but may be assigned by us without restriction.
Use of our brand.
You may not, without our prior written permission, use our name, logos, or other trademarks in connection with products or services other than the Services, or in any other way that implies our affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship. To seek permission, please email us at marketing@anthropic.com.
Export Controls.
You may not export or provide access to the Services into any U.S. embargoed countries or to anyone on (i) the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, (ii) any other restricted party lists identified by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, (iii) the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List, or (iv) any other restricted party lists. You represent and warrant that you and anyone accessing or using the Services on your behalf, or using your Account credentials, are not such persons or entities and are not located in any such country.
Legal Compliance.
We may comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to provision or use of the Services, or to information provided to or collected under our Terms. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to report information from or about you, including but not limited to Inputs, Outputs, or Actions to law enforcement.
U.S. Government Use.
The Services were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation within the meaning of the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations and their agency supplements. Accordingly, U.S. Government users of the Services will have only those rights that are granted to all other end users of the Services pursuant to these Terms.
13. In case of disputes
Equitable relief.
You agree that (a) no adequate remedy exists at law if you breach Section 3 (Use of Our Services); (b) it would be difficult to determine the damages resulting from such breach, and any such breach would cause irreparable harm; and (c) a grant of injunctive relief provides the best remedy for any such breach. You waive any opposition to such injunctive relief, as well as any demand that we prove actual damage or post a bond or other security in connection with such injunctive relief.
Governing law and exclusive jurisdiction.
Our Terms will be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without giving effect to conflict of law principles. You and Anthropic agree that any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and you and Anthropic submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. By accessing our Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other jurisdictions.

Legal:
Integrations related to legal interpretation, legal guidance, or decisions with legal implications
Healthcare:
Integrations affecting healthcare decisions, medical diagnosis, patient care, or medical guidance. Wellness advice (e.g., advice on sleep, stress, nutrition, exercise, etc.) does not fall under this category
Insurance:
Integrations related to health, life, property, disability, or other types of insurance underwriting, claims processing, or coverage decisions
Finance:
Integrations related to financial decisions, including investment advice, loan approvals, and determining financial eligibility or creditworthiness
Employment and housing:
Integrations related to decisions about the employability of individuals, resume screening, hiring tools, or other employment determinations or decisions regarding eligibility for housing, including leases and home loans
Academic testing, accreditation and admissions:
Integrations related to standardized testing companies that administer school admissions (including evaluating, scoring or ranking prospective students), language proficiency, or professional certification exams; agencies that evaluate and certify educational institutions.
Media or professional journalistic content:
Integrations related to using our products or services to automatically generate content and publish it for external consumption
If your integration is listed above, we require that you implement the additional safety measures listed below:
Human-in-the-loop:
when using our products or services to provide advice, recommendations, or subjective decisions that directly impact individuals in high-risk domains, a qualified professional in that field must review the content or decision prior to dissemination or finalization. This requirement applies specifically to content or decisions that are provided to consumers or the general public, or decisions made about an individual. Your business is responsible for the accuracy and appropriateness of that information. For other types of content generation or interactions with users that do not involve direct advice, recommendations, or subjective decisions, human review is strongly encouraged but not mandatory.
Disclosure:
you must disclose to your customers or end users that you are using our services to help inform your decisions or recommendations.
Disclosure Requirements
Finally, the below use cases – regardless of whether they are High Risk Use Cases – must disclose to their users that they are interacting with an AI system rather than a human:
All customer-facing chatbots
including any external-facing or interactive AI agent
Products serving minors:
Organizations providing minors with the ability to directly interact with products that incorporate our API(s).
Note:
These organizations must also comply with the additional guidelines outlined in our
Help Center article

Anthropic is an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and process your personal data when you use our website and other places where Anthropic acts as a
data controller
—for example, when you interact with Claude.ai or other products as a consumer for personal use ("
Services
") or when Anthropic operates and provides our commercial customers and their end users with access to our commercial products, such as the Claude Team plan (“
Commercial Services
”).
This Privacy Policy does not apply where Anthropic acts as a
data processor
and processes personal data on behalf of commercial customers using Anthropic’s Commercial Services – for example, your employer has provisioned you a Claude for Work account, or you're using an app that is powered on the back-end with Claude. In those cases, the commercial customer is the controller, and you can review their policies for more information about how they handle your personal data.
For information about how we collect and use personal data to develop our language models that power our Services, when we may receive and process personal data of non-users, and your choices with respect to that information, please see our
Notice on Model Training
.
This Privacy Policy also describes your privacy rights. More information about your rights, and how to exercise them, is set out in Section 4 (“Rights and Choices”).
If you are located in Canada, please read section 11 of the Privacy Policy which applies to you.

We shall collect your payment information if you choose to purchase access to Anthropic’s products and services.
Inputs and Outputs:
Our AI services allow you to interact with the Services in a variety of formats (

), which generate responses (
“Outputs”
) based on your Inputs. This includes where you choose to integrate third-party applications with our services. If you include personal data or reference external content in your Inputs, we will collect that information and this information may be reproduced in your Outputs.
Feedback on your use of our Services:
We appreciate feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating an Output in response to an Input ("
Feedback
"). If you rate an Output in response to an Input—for example, by using the thumbs up/thumbs down icon—we will store the entire related conversation as part of your Feedback. You can learn more about how we use Feedback

4. Rights and Choices
Depending on where you live and the laws that apply in your country of residence, you may enjoy certain rights regarding your personal data, as described further below. However, please be aware that these rights are limited, and that the process by which we may need to action your requests regarding our training dataset are complex. We may also decline a request if we have a lawful reason for doing so. That said, we strive to prioritize the protection of personal data, and comply with all applicable privacy laws.
To exercise your rights, you or an authorized agent may submit a request by emailing us at
privacy@anthropic.com
. After we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. You may also have the right to appeal requests that we deny by emailing
privacy@anthropic.com
. Anthropic will not discriminate based on the exercising of privacy rights you may have. Set out below is a summary of the rights which you may enjoy, depending on the laws that apply in your country of residence.
Right to know:
the right to know what personal data Anthropic processes about you, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collection, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.
Access & data portability:
the right to request a copy of the personal data Anthropic processes about you, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. In certain cases and subject to applicable law, you have the right to port your information.
Deletion:
the right to request that we delete personal data collected from you when you use our Services, subject to certain exceptions. You also are able to
delete individual conversations
, which will be removed immediately from your conversation history and automatically deleted from our back-end within 30 days. Learn more
here
.
Correction:
the right to request that we correct inaccurate personal data Anthropic retains about you, subject to certain exceptions. Please note that we cannot guarantee the factual accuracy of Outputs. If Outputs contain factually inaccurate personal data relating to you, you can submit a correction request and we will make a reasonable effort to correct this information—but due to the technical complexity of our large language models, it may not always be possible for us to do so.
Objection:
the right to object to processing of your personal data, including profiling conducted on grounds of public or legitimate interest. In places where such a right applies, we will no longer process the personal data in case of such objection unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. If we use your information for direct marketing, you can object and opt out of future direct marketing messages using the unsubscribe link in such communications.
Restriction:
the right to restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.
Withdrawal of consent.
Where Anthropic’s processing of your personal data is based on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent. The withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Automated decision-making
: Anthropic does not engage in decision making based solely on automated processing or profiling in a manner which produces a legal effect (i.e., impacts your legal rights) or significantly affects you in a similar way (e.g., significantly affects your financial circumstances or ability to access essential goods or services).

5. Data Transfers
When you access our website or Services, your personal data may be transferred to our servers in the US, or to other countries outside the European Economic Area (
“EEA”
) and the UK. This may be a direct provision of your personal data to us, or a transfer that we or a third party make.
Where information is transferred outside the EEA or the UK, we ensure it benefits from an adequate level of data protection by relying on:
Adequacy decisions.
These are decisions from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country outside of the EEA offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to some countries with adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed
here
; or
Standard contractual clauses.
The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “Collection of Personal Data” to certain affiliates and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.
In certain situations, we rely on derogations provided for under applicable data protection law to transfer information to a third country.
6. Data Retention, Data Lifecycle, and Security Controls
Anthropic retains your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes and criteria outlined in this Privacy Policy and explained further in our
privacy center
.
When the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.
Aggregated or De-Identified Information
We may process personal data in an aggregated or de-identified form to analyze the effectiveness of our Services, conduct research, study user behavior, and train our AI models as permitted under applicable laws. For instance:
When you submit Feedback, we disassociate Inputs and Outputs from your user ID to use them for training and improving our models.
If our systems flag Inputs or Outputs for potentially violating our
Usage Policy
, we disassociate the content from your user ID to train our trust and safety internal classification and generative models. However, we may re-identify the Inputs or Outputs to enforce our Usage Policy with the responsible user if necessary.
To improve user experience, we may analyze and aggregate general user behavior and usage data. This information does not identify individual users.
Security Controls Relating to our Processing of Personal Data
We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
7. Children
Our Services are not directed towards, and we do not knowingly collect, use, disclose, sell, or share any information about, children under the age of 18. If you become aware that a child under the age of 18 has provided any personal data to us while using our Services, please email us at

In case of conflict between our Privacy Policy and these supplemental disclosures, the supplemental disclosures shall prevail in relation to residents of Brazil.
Legal Bases. Depending on the specific purpose of the processing, we may rely on different grounds than those listed under section 2, where permitted by and in accordance with the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (LGPD). For example, we may rely on the "exercise of legal rights" basis to process personal data associated with customer complaints and to enforce our Terms of Service and similar terms and agreements, including our Usage Policy.
Data Subject's Rights. LGPD grants certain rights regarding your personal data, which differ from the ones listed under section 4. We will respond to your requests to exercise your rights below in accordance with applicable law:

Information of public and private entities with which we shared data. You have the right to request information of public and private entities with which we have shared your data.

Withdrawal of your consent. You have the right to withdraw your consent. This procedure will be carried out free of charge.
Request a review of decisions made solely based on automated processing of personal data.
Please keep in mind that these rights are not absolute and may not apply in certain circumstances. For example, in certain cases we may continue to process and retain data regardless of your request for deletion, objection, blocking or anonymisation, in order to comply with legal, contractual and regulatory obligations, safeguard and exercise rights, including in judicial, administrative and arbitration proceedings and in other cases provided for by law.
International Data Transfers. You acknowledge that Anthropic is a company based and headquartered in the United States. Any information we hold about you will be transferred to, used, processed, and stored in the United States and other countries and territories, which may not have data privacy or data protection laws equivalent to those in your country or territory.

In the case of Brazil, we will rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for our data transfers where required and in instances where they are not covered by an adequacy decision. These SCCs have been approved by the Brazilian Data Protection Authority (ANPD), which is the "competent supervisory authority" for these transfers, as governed by Brazilian Data Protection Laws.
