Aye aye! Here be the NSW Government’s Generative AI guidance, rewritten as if it came from the Captain’s log o’ the high-tech seas. Batten down the hatches and read on, ye landlubbers!

# ⚓ *Generative AI: A Pirate’s Code for the Digital Seas* 🏴‍☠️

## 🏴 Overview

This here be a scroll of guidance for all government crew in New South Wales wishin’ to set sail with the magical powers of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI). It lays down the sacred code for responsible, safe, and honourable use of these uncanny contraptions, built atop the old charts of artificial intelligence law.

As more ships in the fleet hoist the AI sails, every sailor must stay alert and wise. Each Agency must draw up its own sea laws, but if yer compass be spinning, look to this very guide as yer North Star.

## 🧜 What in the Seven Seas Be Gen AI?

Gen AI be a trickster's magic, conjurin’ text, images, maps, music, or code from a mere whisper of a prompt. ‘Tis the stuff behind ChatGPT, Bard, MidJourney, and the mighty Copilot. Say a few words and boom—out comes somethin’ shiny, or sometimes, somethin’ cursed.

## ☠️ Why Should Ye Care?

Mark me words: this black box sorcery is workin’ its way into every port and parchment. It can help with scribblin’ memos, findin’ treasure (a.k.a. research), or translatin’ bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo into plain sailor’s tongue. But beware—it sometimes *hallucinates*, spittin’ out nonsense with all the confidence of a drunken parrot.

It also learns from the flotsam of the internet, which may carry the bias of the old world. If ye be careless, ye might spread falsehoods or offend whole crews.

## 🪙 Are Ye Usin’ It?

If ye be typin’ into a magic box and it spits back text, drawings, or sound, ye be usin’ Gen AI. Whether ‘tis obvious like ChatGPT or sneaky like Copilot hidin’ in yer spreadsheets—yer dabblin’ in techno-sorcery.

## ⚔️ Pirate’s Code for AI Use

**🧾 Never enter secrets or treasure maps (i.e., sensitive or personal info).**
Ye don’t want to be walkin’ the legal plank for leakin’ crew secrets!

**🧠 Mind what ye say—it trains the beast.**
The machine learns from yer questions, so don't be feedin’ it poison or lies.

**🗺️ Be clever with yer prompts.**
A misspelled word or awkward ask might send the genie off-course.

**📚 Don’t believe every tale it tells.**
Always double-check the treasure map—it may lead ye to Kraken-infested waters.

**⚖️ Beware bias and twisted truths.**
Gen AI don’t know right from wrong—it just guesses with flair.

**🖋️ Mark yer sources.**
If the AI helped with yer scroll, give it credit so others don’t think ye wrote it with yer own quill.

**🧑‍🎤 Respect the voices and faces o’ others.**
Don’t be conjurin’ art or songs from another soul without their blessing—or ye may find yerself cursed by the bards' guild.

**🪵 Own yer words.**
If AI helps ye write, make sure ye understand every word afore it’s posted to the mast.

**🛡️ Follow Cyber Security NSW’s orders.**
The sea be full o’ pirates—protect yer ship with the proper spells and shields.

**🚫 No AI in decision-makin’ without the Captain’s approval (a.k.a. NSW AI Assessment Framework).**

## 🧭 Examples of Good Sailin’

**📜 Use Case: Policy Research**
Jordan, the policy cartographer, asks Gen AI for maps and scrolls on how foreign ports track wind and sun power. He double-checks the findings with real maps afore settin’ sail.

**📚 Use Case: Understandin’ Gobbledygook**
Alex reads a cursed scroll full of legalese. Gen AI helps translate it to plain speech, but Alex still checks with the town elders.

**🎓 Use Case: Creatin’ a Lesson Plan**
Joon needs to train the crew in policy-writin’. Gen AI throws out ideas, but Joon sharpens ‘em into a fine cutlass and makes sure no IP laws be broken.

## ☠️ Examples of Foolishness That’ll Sink Yer Ship

**📕 Use Case: Sensitive Docs**
Rajesh, a policy scribe, wisely decides *not* to feed Gen AI a scroll filled with private health info, knowin’ it could end badly.

**💰 Use Case: Financial Sorcery**
Aisha, the coin counter, keeps AI far from the ledgers, knowin’ it can’t count doubloons right and might cause a mutiny.

**🎨 Use Case: Art Theft**
Alex wants pretty pictures for the town square website but stops when they realise the Gen AI may be pillagin’ from real artists. Instead, they hire honest artisans.

## ⚓ Final Word From the Crow’s Nest

Remember: ye be responsible for yer own sailin’. Know the law, protect the crew’s privacy, and don’t be takin’ shortcuts lest ye find yerself in hot water.

This scroll was written with help from ChatGPT, who polished the grammar and smoothed the waves. If ye be craftin’ yer own AI policies, send word to the AI Council in the Governor’s quarters.

Now go forth, and may yer AI voyage be bold—but not reckless. 🏴‍☠️

Shall I now render this into a scroll suitable for hangin’ in a captain’s quarters, or perhaps post it on the mess hall wall for all hands to see?
