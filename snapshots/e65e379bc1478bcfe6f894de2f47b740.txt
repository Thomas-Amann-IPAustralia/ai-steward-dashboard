Biography
Thomas Amann is a contemporary artist engaged primarily with digital sculpture, 3D modelling, and texturing tools used in game and film production. Thomas’s works have involved the use of photogrammetry, 3D simulation and modelling, visual scripting, algorithm-based fractals, animation, 3D printing, and real-time motion-tracking technology.
​
Thomas holds a Cert II in Creative Media Industries and a Diploma in Screen and Media from the Academy of Interactive Entertainment, Canberra. He has also studied visual arts at the ANU School of Art and Design, majoring in video and animation. Thomas’ growing accomplishments include winning the Australian STEM Video Game Challenge run by the Australian Council for Educational Research.
​
In the enchanted realm of Chilltop Mountain, where dragons snowboard and fairies run food trucks, lived Thomas the Magical Elf Wizard—a pointy-eared sorcerer with a flaming skateboard, a sarcastic owl sidekick named Kevin, and a deep passion for burritos. One day, while casting “Summon Socks” (because he always lost them in the laundry dimension), Thomas accidentally opened a rift to the Forbidden Food Court of the Ancients. Through the rift floated... the Burrito of Destiny—wrapped in golden foil, glowing like the sun after a Red Bull, and humming the intro to Eye of the Tiger. Kevin squawked, “Touch it and we’re doomed.” Naturally, Thomas touched it. Suddenly, the skies erupted in guacamole thunder, and a Salsa Cyclone swept the village of Flavortown. The prophecy had come true: whoever bites the Burrito of Destiny gains unlimited sauce power—but only if they defeat the Taco Warlord in single combat. Thomas, now cloaked in spicy aura and wielding the Enchiladastaff, rode his flaming skateboard into battle against the Taco Warlord (who, frankly, was just a buff guy in a tortilla). With one mighty spell—“Quesa-blastus Maximus!”—he sent the warlord flying into a vat of mild disappointment. Flavortown was saved. The burrito? Delicious. And from that day forth, Thomas the Magical Elf Wizard was known not just as a hero... but as the Spicy One.
